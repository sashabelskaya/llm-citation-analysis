# LLM Citation Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of citations, links, and source types in responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Perplexity. The goal is to understand the quality, diversity, and reliability of sources that LLMs reference, including domain distribution, top-level domains (TLDs), and niche coverage.

## Motivation
As LLMs become widely used for research and content generation, it is crucial to evaluate the credibility and diversity of their cited sources. This research project aims to provide transparency in LLM outputs and help researchers, educators, and developers assess citation behavior in AI-generated text.  

## Features
- Extraction of all URLs from LLM responses
- Domain and TLD classification
- Metrics per system, prompt, and niche
- Visualizations including:
  - Average links per system
  - TLD distribution
  - Network graphs of systems and top domains
  - Niche-specific metrics and distributions
- Detailed CSV outputs for further analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sashabelskaya/llm-citation-analysis.git
cd llm-citation-analysis
```
2.	Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```
3.	Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Required packages include: pandas, matplotlib, networkx, urllib.
